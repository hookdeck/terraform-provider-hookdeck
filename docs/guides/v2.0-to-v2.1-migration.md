This release focuses on internal provider improvements with new features, bug fixes, and one minor breaking change that may require updating your configuration.

## Breaking Change

### Removed: `sdk_max_attempts` Provider Configuration

The `sdk_max_attempts` configuration option has been removed from the provider.

**Action Required**: Remove `sdk_max_attempts` from your provider configuration if present.

```hcl
# Before
provider "hookdeck" {
  api_key = "..."
  sdk_max_attempts = 5  # REMOVE THIS LINE
}

# After
provider "hookdeck" {
  api_key = "..."
}
```

## New Features

- **Deduplication Rules**: Connections now support [deduplication rules](https://hookdeck.com/docs/deduplication)
- **Transformation Hard Deletion**: Transformations are now permanently deleted instead of being renamed to `deleted-...`
- **Improved JSON Handling**: Filter rules now accept any valid JSON format without requiring specific encoding

## Improvements

- Automatic rate limiting to respect Hookdeck API limits (240 requests/minute)

The changes in this release are mostly improvements with minimal impact on existing configurations.
